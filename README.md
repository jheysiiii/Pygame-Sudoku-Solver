# Pygame Sudoku Solver üêç

I started solving sudoku puzzles a couple of weeks ago and I enjoy it very much. Because I got more confident in my skills of solving it by hand I wanted to see if I could write a computer program to do it for me. Analogue to the old saying ‚ÄúYou never really know something until you teach it to someone else‚Äù, I thought I'd teach my computer. üòäüñ•Ô∏è

## Usage

To use it, all you have to do is install the required libraries in requirements.txt (ssspoiler, there's only one) and run the main script with "python3 ./solver.py". Works great on Windows/Mac/Linux.

You can see a video of me demoing the program [in this video](https://youtu.be/MvDNnjlcqoY)!


## Settings

Inside of the folder there is a file, settings.txt. Inside of it each setting is explained and all you have to do is change the parameters that you want and save the file before opening the solver.

## Controls

It's rather simple to control. You can **click** on any square and it will turn green telling you that you can input a number there. If the number you try to input is illegal, it will flash red.

Once you are ready to start the solving mechanism, just press **space**.

Pressing **d** will switch between light mode and dark mode.

Pressing **r** will reset the whole puzzle.
